			This field is only used when you specify the same compatibility with
			another project multiple times.
			Do note that this feature may have been deactivated in the
			Project Creation Engine, in which case only the first
			of compatibility defined here will be used and this field will
			be ignored. This also happens, if the field is left empty on more
			than one of the multiple mentions.
