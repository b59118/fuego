<p>
In this section, you can define classes that can be assigned to
"inheritance projects". This is used to group those projects together in a way,
that allows Jenkins to automatically create new projects that inherit their
properties from both classes.
</p>
<p>
Imagine, that you define two classes "Car" and "Motor" here and then define a
mating between those two classes in the section below.
<br/>
Imagine further, that you assign the jobs "Ford" and "BMW" to the "Cars"-class
and "V8" and "V12" to the "Motor"-class.
</p>
<p>
Given these conditions, this plugin will generate the following projects:
<ul>
	<li>Ford_V8</li>
	<li>Ford_V12</li>
	<li>BMW_V8</li>
	<li>BMW_V12</li>
</ul>
The inheritance of properties and steps is ordered as stated. That means, for
example, that steps defined in "Ford" will	be executed before those of "V8"
and that parameters of "V8" will overwrite/extend those of "Ford".
</p>
<p>
Also do note that all these classes will be created as transient projects.
That means, that you will not be able to change their properties &mdash;
except by altering their parent projects &mdash; and that they will also not
be saved when Jenkins is shut down. Instead, they are regenerated from scratch.
Only the builds that ran on them are saved to disk and loaded as soon as the
projects are regenerated.
