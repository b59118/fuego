<div>
You can set a specific node label here, which will be treated as a "magic"
value during the evaluation of the restrictions on running jobs.
<p>
	If a value is set here and you start a job that is an Inheritance Job
	<b>and</b> has restrictions on labels, Jenkins will check if you make any
	reference of the "magic" value in the label expression.
</p>
<p>
	If not, Jenkins will add an "and" term with the negated magic value.
	That means, these jobs will <b>not</b> run on nodes that carry the magic
	label.<br/>
	If there is a reference, Jenkins will do nothing and just return the
	label that you specified. This way, you can select manually whether or not
	to run jobs on test-machines that are marked with the "magic" label.
