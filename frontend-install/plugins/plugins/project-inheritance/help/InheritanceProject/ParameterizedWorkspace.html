	If you enable this check-box, you can enter a directory name into the text
	box. This name can contain an arbitrary amount of deeply nested variables.
	<br/>
	That means, that all variables will be repeatedly evaluated, until none
	remain, two consecutive evaluations are identical or a preset (but high)
	number of evaluations were done.<br/>
	<br/>
	The string generated in that way is then checked if it is an absolute path,
	or a relative path. If absolute, it is used as-is; if relative, it is
	expanded to rest below the normal "workspace" directory of the node.
	<br/>
	The resulting path is then used as the workspace-root for this compound.
	This means, that if multiple compounds using this root are run at the same
	time, multiple parallel workspaces are spawned. Each will be amended with
	"@2", "@3", etc.<br/>
	<br/>
	This functionality is <b>highly useful</b>, if you have multiple different
	compounds that reference the same source code repository and so do not need
	to have fully distinct workspaces.
	<br/>
	In case this path evaluates to an empty string, or one only containing
	whitespaces, the default behaviour of Jenkins is used.
