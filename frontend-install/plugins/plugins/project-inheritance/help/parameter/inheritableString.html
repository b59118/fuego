<div>
    Defines an inheritable text parameter, where users can enter a string value,
    which you can use during a build, either as an environment variable, or
    through variable substitution in some other parts of the configuration.<br/>
    The difference to a normal String-Parameter is, that this parameter will
    alter its behaviour when inherited to child projects.<br/>
    You can either:
    <ul>
    	<li>
    		Keep the old behaviour of the parameter being overwritten by
    		the project with the highest priority,
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		allow the parameter to be extended by higher-prioritised projects,
    		or
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		completely prevent any overwriting. In that case, the first project
    		to set a variable (the one with the lowest priority) will set the
    		variable.
    	</li>
    </ul>
    Furthermore, you can toggle the mandatory flag between two states:
    <ul>
    	<li>
    		If set to mandatory, the parameter has to be set,
    		before a build can be started. This might happen automatically
    		through a default value. The creator of a child project will be
    		warned during configuration, if a particular parameter is not
    		yet set.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		If set to optional, the parameter can be assigned freely.
    	</li>
    </ul>
    Do note that children can alter these flags on inheriting them, with the
    following exceptions:
    <ul>
    	<li>
    		They may not change a mandatory field to be optional. They are
    		allowed to set a default though, which makes this field effectively
    		non-mandatory. 
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		They are incapable (by design) of altering the overwritable
    		flag. Of course, they can always set an overwritable parameter to
    		non-overwritable.
    	</li>
    	<li>
    		While allowed, changing the flag from overwritable to extensible
    		and/or back can lead to surprising results, as the output depends
    		on the serialisation of the parameters according to their order.<br/>
    		Assume a parameter is overwritable in A and extensible in B and both
    		are inherited by C.<br/>
    		If A is ordered before B, then:
    		<ul>
    			<li>
    				C will only get the value of B, and
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				if C overwrites the value, it will extend the value.
    			</li>
    		</ul>
    		If B is ordered before A, then:
    		<ul>
    			<li>
    				C will get the value of B extended by A, and
    			</li>
    			<li>
    				if C overwrites the value, it will replace it completely.
    			</li>
    		</ul> 
    	</li>
    </ul>
    Violating these restrictions results in a non-buildable project and a
    warning during configuration. This may happen insidiously, if a parameter
    is defined separately in two parents with differing flags.
