    The purpose of this plugin is to manage conflicts between jobs. 
    
  <p>
    In order to manage resources conflicts, you can assign resources name to every jobs on Jenkins.
    This feature will be in charge of not building jobs that have same resources at the same time.

  <p>
    To use this feature,you have to activate the plugin and add name of resource(s) on each job that need it.
    For example, if you add a resource : "project1Database" on two jobs, it means that they can't be
    built at the same time. This is achieved without having to manage manually builds.
  <p>
    You can add as many resources that you need.
    
  <p>
     The next step to configure Exclusion plugin is to add two building steps. 
     The first one named "Critical block start" delimites the beginning of the exclusion zone.
     The second one named "Critical block end" which releases resources previously allocated.
