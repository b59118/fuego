	<p>Allows you to specify another job to use as a template, if it has the option enabled.</p>
	<p>
		Everything is copied verbatim whenever this job is saved from the other project <em>except</em> the parameters,
		which everything is copied from them except their default values.
		You should change those values to make this build unique.
	</p>
	<p>
		Whenever the specified template job is saved, this job will automatically be synced, and any parameters specified will be used.
