This is the CHANGELOG file for the Fuego test framework

This file is in tbwiki markdown format, based on the Changelog format
described at: http://keepachangelog.com/

This file is for human-readable, high-level changes (not just a 
git log dump), with the intent to help people decide when they
want to upgrade Fuego versions.

Note that Fuego is distributed as two repositories, one with docker
and Jenkins stuff, and one with the fuego tests and script system.
This file serves as the common changelog for both repositories.
