Jenkins Test Automation
=======================

Installing JTA to docker container
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Run install.sh from top directory. This will launch ``docker build'' command.
Please modify Dockerfile to suit your needs.

Running
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issue the following commands from top directory:

jta-host-scripts/docker-create-containter.sh
jta-host-scripts/docker-start-container.sh

Web interface will be available at http://localhost:8080

Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please see manual (docs/jta-docs.pdf) for configuration and using.

docker-create-containter.sh configures Docker to use host network (--net="host" option).
Please see Docker manual for different network setup.

Container is configured to run ssh server at 2222 port. Modify container-cfg/sshd_config file if you need to configure ssh server differently.

Updating
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While inside docker container go to /home/jenkins/jta and issue ``git pull''.
This will update the following components:
- JTA engine
- tests
- overlays
- jenkins jobs

Boards configuration, toolchain setup and Jenkins' config.xml will not be touched since these are located in external docker volume that is mounted to /userdata inside container.
